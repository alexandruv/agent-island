# Issue #4 validation

2026-10-13, assigned `agent/issue-4` worktree only.

- PASS: fresh `npm ci` (28 packages, zero audit vulnerabilities), TypeScript check and Vite static build. Node 26.10.0, npm 11.19.1. Host default npm cache was unwritable; used `--cache /private/tmp/agent-island-issue-4-npm-cache` without altering permissions. Install script policy was left intact.
- PASS: seven Node tests covering station/claim mapping, explicit merge/preview metadata, preview provenance and URL restrictions, offline/stale/unknown state, fixture IDs/states, detail content and static entry/import references.
- Build emits `dist/index.html`, CSS and two local JS assets. Three.js is lazy-loaded; Vite reports a roughly 505 kB scene chunk warning. No runtime server or secrets are needed.
- BLOCKED: phone 360px/keyboard/dialog, desktop/WebGL/fallback and reduced-motion browser assertions. Initial Playwright invocation found no installed browser. Installed Chromium into a writable temporary cache, then attempted the suite with one worker and max-failures=1. macOS denied browser startup before any assertion: `bootstrap_check_in ... Permission denied (1100)`. One launch failed, two tests did not run. No screenshots or visual/phone success claims are supplied.
- Evidence: [browser-host-block.log](browser-host-block.log). No denied launch was retried; no OS/security control was altered. Operator browser/phone verification and independent review remain pending before deployment.

No preview was deployed, and production is untouched.
